    "# Introduction to MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the open-source library [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/), a popular ML lifecycle management framework built and mantained by Databricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **_NOTE:_**  You can use this tutorial interactively as a jupyter notebook by cloning this repo and installing it with \n",
    " `poetry install` and then launching the `README.ipynb` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MLflow's \"Hello world!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic functionality of MLflow covers experiment tracking. The MLflow Tracking component is an API and UI for logging parameters, code versions, metrics, and output files when running your machine learning code and for later visualizing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **_NOTE:_**  In this first part, we will use MLflow *locally* (its default setup), meaning that all metadata and artifacts are stored in your working directory (under `mlruns/`). In the second part, we will connect to the remote MLflow server available at MeteoSwiss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the Tracking API\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLflow Tracking API lets you log metrics and artifacts (files) from your data science code and see a history of your runs. You can see it at work in the example below:"
